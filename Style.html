<h2>Girls world</h2>
<p>Being a girl is cool, but it isn’t always easy! For no good reason, girls are not always given the same chances as boys.
For example, in some countries, girls are not offered an education . In fact, 66 million girls around the world are out of school!
Have you ever been told that you couldn’t do something because you were “a girl”? Never forget that people said the very same thing to Amelia Earhart when she decided that she wanted to be a pilot. Sally Ride was told the same thing when she wanted to become the first female astronaut. They did not listen to the crowd. They followed their dreams and their hearts and they reached their goals. You can too.

<p> feel lucky to be a girl darling  </p>
